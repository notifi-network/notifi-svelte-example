# Notifi Svelte Example

You can build a Svelte Dapp with Notifi SDK. This is an example of how to use Notifi SDK (`@notifi-network/notifi-react`) in a Svelte project

## Getting started

Cone this project, fill in the `.env` file with your Notifi testnet credentials and run the following commands:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and you should see the example app running.

> NOTE: You need to have a Notifi Tenant account to kickstart the project. You can create a tenant account through [Notifi Admin Portal](https://admin.notifi.network/)
